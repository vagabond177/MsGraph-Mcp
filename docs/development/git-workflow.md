# Git Workflow Standard

**Type:** Procedure
**Purpose:** Git branching strategy and contribution workflow

---

## Branch Strategy

**Protected branches:**
- `main` - Production-ready code, PR-only, no direct commits

**Working branches:**
- `feature/*` - New features (e.g., `feature/email-search`)
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/auth-token-refresh`)
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/api-reference`)
- `test/*` - Test improvements (e.g., `test/integration-coverage`)

---

## Workflow

**1. Create feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

**2. Make changes with TDD:**
```bash
# Write test
npm run test:watch

# Implement
# ... code changes ...

# Verify
npm test
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

**3. Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature with tests"
# Pre-commit hook runs automatically
```

**4. Push branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
# Pre-push hook runs tests
```

**5. Create PR:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "Add feature" --body "Description"
```

**6. Wait for CI/CD:**
- All tests pass
- Coverage meets 80% threshold
- Linter passes
- Type check passes

**7. Request review:**
- At least 1 approver required

**8. Merge:**
- Squash and merge (preferred)
- Delete branch after merge

## Branch Protection Rules

**Main branch protection (configured in GitHub):**

**Require pull requests:**
- âœ“ Require pull request before merging
- âœ“ Require 1 approval
- âœ“ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
- âœ“ Require review from code owners (if CODEOWNERS file exists)

**Require status checks:**
- âœ“ Require status checks to pass before merging
- âœ“ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Required checks:
  - `Run Tests (18.x)`
  - `Run Tests (20.x)`
  - `Lint and Format`

**Additional restrictions:**
- âœ“ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
- âœ“ Restrict who can push to matching branches (admins only for emergencies)
- âœ— Allow force pushes (disabled)
- âœ— Allow deletions (disabled)

## Emergency Hotfix Process

**For critical production issues only:**

**1. Create hotfix branch from main:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b fix/critical-issue
```

**2. Fix issue with test:**
```bash
# Add failing test demonstrating bug
# Fix bug
# Verify test passes
npm test
```

**3. Fast-track PR:**
```bash
git push -u origin fix/critical-issue
gh pr create --title "HOTFIX: Critical issue" --body "Details"
```

**4. Request immediate review:**
- Tag reviewer for urgent review
- Merge as soon as CI passes + 1 approval

---

## Configuration Steps

**To enable branch protection on GitHub:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/vagabond177/MsGraph-Mcp/settings/branches

2. Click "Add branch protection rule"

3. Configure as follows:
   - Branch name pattern: `main`
   - âœ“ Require a pull request before merging
     - Required approvals: 1
     - âœ“ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - âœ“ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - âœ“ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Search and add required checks:
       - `Run Tests` (both 18.x and 20.x will appear after first workflow run)
       - `Lint and Format`
   - âœ“ Restrict who can push to matching branches
     - Add: admins only
   - âœ— Allow force pushes (leave unchecked)
   - âœ— Allow deletions (leave unchecked)

4. Click "Create" or "Save changes"
